# Create project file

Launch Vivado

On the TCL console command line, issuing the following commands

```
cd <ztachip installation folder>/HW/examples/GHRD
set argv linux # For Linux Only
source create_project.tcl
```

A project file ztachip.xpr should be created after the completion of the execution of create_project.tcl.


# Build and flash procedure. 

Open Vivado project file ztachip/HW/examples/GHRD/ztachip.xpr

Then start with synthesis step as shown below

![vivado step1](images/vivado_step1.bmp)

After systhesis step has been completed, Vivado will prompt you to continue with Implementation step. Choose the option and click OK.

![vivado step2](images/vivado_step2.bmp)

After Implementation step has been completed, Vivado will prompt you to continue with Bitstream Generation step. Choose the option and click OK. 

![vivado step3](images/vivado_step3.bmp)

After Bistream Generation step has been completed, Vivado will prompt you to Open Hardware Manager. Choose the option and click OK.

Make sure your board is connected to PC with provided USB cable by Arty Devlopment package.

From Hardware Manager, connect to target as shown below 

![vivado step5](images/vivado_step5.bmp)

On the left panel, click on "Add Configuration Memory Device" menu option and then choose to create the flash device as shown below

![vivado step5](images/vivado_step5_1.bmp)

Then program the board as shown below. The image to be flashed is ztachip/HW/examples/GHRD/ztachip.runs/impl_1/main.bin

If the file is not there, verify that -bin option is selected under ProjectSettngs/BitStream and then rerun the BitStream Generation step.

That's it. Your board's FPGA will be programmed with the new image automatically after power reboot.

# Support for opensource toolchain

Opensource tool chain normally supports only Verilog.

You can convert ztachip rtl to verilog using ghdl

Install [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl)

Then convert RTL code from VHDL to verilog with command below

```
cd <ztachip folder>/tools/ghdl
./convert.sh
```

All vhdl code will be converted and combined to a single file tools/ghdl/soc.v

As an example for all verilog project, create Vivado project but using [create_project2.tcl](../HW/examples/GHRD/create_project2.tcl) instead
